# UTrain

## What is UTrain?
UTrain is a website that helps beginners to machine learning visually train models through the web. The three steps are explained and easy to follow: first, collect data through files or the browser; second, train the model and watch it learn; third and lastly, make predictions and export your model! Also, users can train their models with different data, such as CSV files, images, or sketches.
